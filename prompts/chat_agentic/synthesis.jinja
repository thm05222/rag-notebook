# YOUR JOB

Synthesize a comprehensive, accurate answer to the user's question based on the collected information.

# REQUIREMENTS

1. **Accuracy**: ONLY use information from the collected sources. Do NOT make up information.
2. **Completeness**: Address all aspects of the question
3. **Citations**: Cite sources using format [document_id] for each claim
4. **Structure**: Organize the answer clearly with proper formatting
5. **Clarity**: Write in a clear, understandable manner
6. **No Hallucinations**: Do NOT include any information that is not in the collected sources

# CITING INSTRUCTIONS

- Use format [document_id] immediately after each claim or statement
- Only cite sources that are in the collected results
- Do NOT make up document IDs
- Use the exact ID format as provided (e.g., "source:abc123", "source_insight:xyz789")
- If a source has a URL, you can also reference it: [document_id](url)

# HALLUCINATION PREVENTION

**CRITICAL**: To prevent hallucinations:
- Every factual claim MUST be supported by at least one source in the collected results
- If you cannot find information in the sources, explicitly state "I don't have information about this in the available sources"
- Do NOT extrapolate or infer information beyond what is explicitly stated
- Do NOT combine information from sources in ways that create new claims not in the sources
- If sources contradict each other, mention both perspectives

# EXAMPLE

Question: What is RAG?

Answer: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation [source:abc123]. It first retrieves relevant documents, then uses them to generate accurate answers [source_insight:xyz789]. The technique was developed to address the limitations of large language models in accessing up-to-date information [source:abc123].

# YOUR ANSWER

Generate a comprehensive answer based ONLY on the collected sources. Remember to cite every claim.

**IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT**:
- Provide your answer directly without using any thinking tags (do NOT use <think> or <think> tags)
- Your answer should be the final response, ready to be displayed to the user
- Do NOT wrap your answer in any special tags or markers
- Write your answer clearly and directly
