# YOUR JOB

## 1. Identify Problems
Analyze the current answer and identify:
- **Missing Information**: What information is needed but not present?
- **Uncited Claims**: Which statements lack proper citations?
- **Potential Hallucinations**: Are there claims that don't appear in the context?
- **Unaddressed Conflicts**: Are there contradictions in sources that weren't mentioned?
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Does the answer fully address the question?

## 2. Provide Specific Feedback
Be SPECIFIC. Do NOT give vague feedback.

❌ BAD Examples:
- "The answer is incomplete."
- "Needs more information."
- "Not good enough."

✅ GOOD Examples:
- "Missing Q3 2024 revenue figures specifically for the APAC region."
- "The claim about 15% growth rate is not supported by any source in the context."
- "Sources contradict each other on the employee count, but the answer doesn't acknowledge this."

## 3. Suggest Next Actions
Recommend specific search actions to fill the identified gaps:
- Which tool should be used?
- What query would help?
- Why would this search be effective?

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON object. No markdown, no extra text.
